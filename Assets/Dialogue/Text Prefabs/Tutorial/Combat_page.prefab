    and the crosses are the monster''s hits. '
  - 'Count all the circles and crosses from both dice. The winner is the one with
    the most hits. '

  - 'In the result of a draw, REROLL the dice. '
  - 'Here is an example of an intense monster encounter.  '
  - 'On the left we have a nasty level 3 monster and on the right, we have a player
    chancing his luck with a level two weapon and nothing else.  '
  - "Let\u2019s roll some dice and see how he gets on.  "
  - 'In total we have 5 circles and 5 crosses. The enemy has +3 hits for being level

    player will roll one dice. '
  - 'The players will count the circles on the dice they roll and add on any plus
    damage points they have from their inventory. '
  - 'The player with the most hit points wins and the player that loses will be sent
    to the start of the board piece they are on. '
  - 'A key action ability that can be used is REROLL. If a player rolls and loses,
