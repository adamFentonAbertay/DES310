  - 'Lets go shopping! Throughout the game you may encounter a shop or two. Shops
    are used for trading. '
  - 'Shops can be located with this symbol on the board. '
  - SHOP
  - RESUME
  - 'When a player enters a shop, they will pull two item cards from the pile based
    on the zone the shop is in.  '
  - 'For example, if a player was to land on a shop located within Zone 2. They would
    pull 2 item cards from the level two pile. '
  - 'These cards then become part of the shop which is laid out on the table and
    is visible to all players. '
  - SHOPHIDE
  - 'The player can simply swap same level items as a straight swap, or the player
    can swap several items together to get a better levelled item.  '
  - 'For example, a simple trade could be these two level one cards for this level
    2 card.  '
  - TRADE
  - RESUME
  - 'When the player swaps their cards for an item in the shop, the cards that they
    have traded in will be added to the right-hand side of the shop. '
  - 'The shop is capped at a 4-card capacity. This means that at the end of a trading
    session extra cards will be discarded. '
  - 'The extra cards are taken from the left-hand side of the shop layout and will
    be put back at the bottom of the item pile.  '
  - TRADEHIDE
  - 'Here is a visual layout of the process of trading.  '
  - TRADEDIAGRAM
  - RESUME
  - 'You may encounter a Crab Boss. If that happens and I''m not saying it will but
    if it does this is what he looks like. '
  - CRABBOSS
  - RESUME
  - 'The Crab Boss has 3 lives, to beat him the player attacking would need to win
    three battles I.e. three dice rolls. '
  - 'When a player loses a battle to The Crab Boss, they will be thrown back to the
    starting tile of the board piece they are on.  '
  - 'The Crab Boss has extra hits based on the level area it is in. For example,
    if you encounter the crab within zone 2, he gets 2 extra hits.  '
  - 'At the end of each round the crab boss will regenerate his lives. So, it might
    be a good idea to work as a team to defeat him! '
  - CRABBOSSHIDE
  - 'Now I think I have covered everything. Feel free to come back to the tutorial
    whenever you are stuck or use the rule book.  '
  - 'Safe travels, young adventurers! '
