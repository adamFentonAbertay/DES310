  - It's time to get moving! Movement on the board is determined by a dice roll.
  - 'The dice faces have circles and crosses on them, the circles are used for movement
    and the crosses are used for combat.  '
  - 'Every turn each player will roll two dices. They will add up the number of circles
    for EACH dice. '
  - 'They have a choice on which dice to use for movement and which one to use for
    action points.  '
  - 'For example, I have rolled two dice, and this is what I''ve gotten.  '
  - DICEROLL
  - RESUME
  - 'If I choose to use the right dice for movement, I will move 3 spaces and receive
    2 action points. '
  - 'Otherwise, if I chose to pick the left dice for movement, I would move 2 spaces
    and gain 3 action points. '
  - HIDEDICEROLL
  - 'Movement is horizontal and vertical, moving diagonally is only allowed if your
    character is the bishop. '
  - 'Monsters also move on the board! At the end of each turn monsters will move
    one space towards the player that just played. '
  - 'ONLY when the player is on the same board piece as the monster. If the player
    is on a different board piece as the monster, the monster will not move '
